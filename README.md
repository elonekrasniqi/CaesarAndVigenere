# Ceasar and Vigenere
This is a semester project developed by students at the University "Hasan Prishtina" - Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, in the course "Data Security" - Prof.Blerim Rexha and Asc.Mergim Hoti.

## Introduction
The Caesar cipher, named after Julius Caesar, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

The Vigenère cipher, invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso and later misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère, is a more complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher. It uses a keyword to shift each letter of the plaintext by a different amount, making it more secure than the Caesar cipher.

This Python application provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text files using either the Caesar cipher or the Vigenère cipher.

### How it Works
1. The user selects the Vigenère or Caesar option.
2. They enter whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a file.
3. They provide the file to be encrypted/decrypted.
4. They select where do they want to save the encrypted/decrypted file.
5. They specify the encryption key.
6. The program performs the encryption/decryption and saves the result to a new file.

### How to Use
- **Clone this repository to your local machine.**
